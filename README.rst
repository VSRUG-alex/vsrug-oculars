VSRUG ocular plugin collection for use in Stellarium.

.. FIXME : link to gallery. GH does not render the linking 
See `Gallery <https://github.com/axd1967/vsrug-oculars/blob/master/img/README.rst>`_.

Copy this file as `ocular.ini` to your local Stellarium config directory (it contains `config.ini`) under `modules/Oculars/`.

Unfortunately, there is currently no way to cleanly merge ocular data from several organisations/places.

- Windows users can best rename the existing file before/after use, in order to keep whatever they created locally
- Linux users are lucky: they can use symlinks.
