# vsrug-oculars

VSRUG ocular collection for use in Stellarium

Copy this file to your local Stellarium config directory (it contains `config.ini`) under `modules/Oculars/`
Unfortunately, there is currently no way to cleanly merge ocular data.

- Windows users can best rename the file before/after use, in order to keep whatever they created locally
- Linux users are lucky: they can use symlinks.
